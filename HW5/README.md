**This code will generate all of the possible position that eight queen can situate** 


## what is my way to reduce the number of trial-and-error? ##

**I use  recursion method to solve this problem**

 **This code will run a loop from 0 to 7 ,which is symbolic for the row 1 to row 8 , and for each iteration , when the possible position is choosen ,then it will mark the imposiible 
 positions for the following iteration , so in the following iterations , we should only pick up the position that han't marked .**
