## learning experience 
  * Learning heap's algorithm *
  * Learning backtracking method for combination *
 
## how to use the implementation, introduce with example code. 
  * Just enter the integer list size that you would like to do the permutation or combination *
  * And then enter your list *
  * Then enter the size of combination list or permutation list *
  * Then enter c if you would like to do combination *
  * Or   enter p if you would like to do permutation *
  * The answer will show in the following lines*



## limitation of my implementation
  * You can use only integer.  *
  * You can not enter the same  number twice    *
